## Description

Welcome to the aiEnhancer.  
This is the first app that ports SISR (Single Image Super Resolution) on your smartphone with comparable state-of-the-art performance on quality and a reasonable processing speed.

It will double the resolution and increase the details quality of any image you choose.  
The better the input image the better the enhanced result.  
-> The BEST RESULTS are given with .png images (no lossy compression).  
-> Beacause the neural network will also enhance jpeg artifacts and gibb's oscillations.  
(If you want a better enhance from a jpeg image just remove them.)

Very important :  
This minimal app hides a very powerful engine.  
The enhacing process is done through a complex artificial intelligence (neural network), right on your device!  
Cause of this advanced technology the app can take some minutes before completing (for big images).  
-> You can look for the progress into the gallery.
